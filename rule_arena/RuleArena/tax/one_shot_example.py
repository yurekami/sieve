Calculate the tax owed by the payer step-by-step according to the information provided by the forms. You should calculate all fields marked with [__]. DO NOT round numbers without explicit instructions. End your response with:
1. "The total tax owed is $xxx." (xxx is a number) if there is tax owed.
2. "The total tax overpaid is $xxx." (xxx is a number) if there is tax overpaid (and should be refunded).
Your response:
To calculate the tax owed by John, we will follow the steps outlined in the provided forms and instructions.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Income

1. Line 1z: Add lines 1a through 1c.
   \[
   \text{Line 1z} = \$93,845 + \$537 + \$165 = \$94,547
   \]

2. Line 8: Additional income from Schedule 1, line 10.
   - Schedule 1, Line 10: Combine lines 1 through 8.
     \[
     \text{Line 10} = \$1,841 + \$2,953 + \$35,600 + \$4,077 + \$1,709 = \$46,180
     \]

3. Line 9: Add lines 1z, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7, and 8.
   \[
   \text{Line 9} = \$94,547 + \$3,132 + \$3,406 + \$18,236 + \$3,500 + \$5,275 + \$0 + \$46,180 = \$174,276
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

4. Line 10: Adjustments to income from Schedule 1, line 26.
   - Schedule 1, Line 26: Add lines 11 through 24.
     \[
     \text{Line 26} = \$206 + \$729 + \$548 + \$1,117 + \$870 = \$3,470
     \]

5. Line 11: Subtract line 10 from line 9.
   \[
   \text{Line 11} = \$174,276 - \$3,470 = \$170,806
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Taxable Income

6. Line 12: Standard deduction for Qualifying surviving spouse.
   \[
   \text{Line 12} = \$27,700
   \]

7. Line 13: Qualified business income deduction.
   \[
   \text{Line 13} = \$2,117
   \]

8. Line 14: Add lines 12 and 13.
   \[
   \text{Line 14} = \$27,700 + \$2,117 = \$29,817
   \]

9. Line 15: Subtract line 14 from line 11.
   \[
   \text{Line 15} = \$170,806 - \$29,817 = \$140,989
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate Tax

10. Line 16: Use the Tax Computation Worksheet for Qualifying surviving spouse.
    - Section B: Taxable income is $140,989.
    - Taxable income is over $100,000 but not over $190,750.
    \[
    \text{Tax} = (\$140,989 \times 0.22) - \$9,385 = \$31,017.58 - \$9,385 = \$21,632.58
    \]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Tax

11. Line 17: Amount from Schedule 2, line 3.
    - Schedule 2, Line 3: Add lines 1 and 2.
      \[
      \text{Line 3} = \$3,272 + \$744 = \$4,016
      \]

12. Line 18: Add lines 16 and 17.
    \[
    \text{Line 18} = \$21,632.58 + \$4,016 = \$25,648.58
    \]

13. Line 20: Amount from Schedule 3, line 8.
    - Schedule 3, Line 7: Add lines 6d, 6i, and 6j.
      \[
      \text{Line 7} = \$117 + \$3,754 + \$611 = \$4,482
      \]
    - Schedule 3, Line 8: Add lines 1 through 4, 5a, 5b, and 7.
      \[
      \text{Line 8} = \$304 + \$684 + \$594 + \$4,482 = \$6,064
      \]

14. Line 21: Add lines 19 and 20.
    \[
    \text{Line 21} = \$0 + \$6,064 = \$6,064
    \]

15. Line 22: Subtract line 21 from line 18.
    \[
    \text{Line 22} = \$25,648.58 - \$6,064 = \$19,584.58
    \]

16. Line 23: Other taxes from Schedule 2, line 21.
    - Schedule 2, Line 21: Add lines 4 and 17.
      \[
      \text{Line 21} = \$0 + \$1,445 = \$1,445
      \]

17. Line 24: Add lines 22 and 23.
    \[
    \text{Line 24} = \$19,584.58 + \$1,445 = \$21,029.58
    \]

### Step 6: Calculate Payments and Amount Owed

18. Line 33: Add lines 25, 26, and 32.
    \[
    \text{Line 33} = \$17,216 + \$0 + \$0 = \$17,216
    \]

19. Line 37: Subtract line 33 from line 24.
    \[
    \text{Line 37} = \$21,029.58 - \$17,216 = \$3,813.58
    \]

The total tax owed is $3,813.58.

Calculate the tax owed by the payer step-by-step according to the information provided by the forms. You should calculate all fields marked with [__]. DO NOT round numbers without explicit instructions. End your response with:
1. "The total tax owed is $xxx." (xxx is a number) if there is tax owed.
2. "The total tax overpaid is $xxx." (xxx is a number) if there is tax overpaid (and should be refunded).
Your response:
Let me help calculate the tax step by step.
Form 1040:
1. Line 1z = Line 1a + Line 1b + Line 1c = $121,150 + $393 + $4,211 = $125,754
2. Line 8 (from Schedule 1, Line 10) = $987 + $2,311 + $0 + $43,253 + $0 + $0 + $3,920 + $721 = $51,192 (sum of Schedule 1 Lines 1-8)
3. Line 9 (total income) = Line 1z + Line 2b + Line 3b + Line 4b + Line 5b + Line 6b + Line 7 + Line 8 = $125,754 + $3,962 + $2,494 + $3,663 + $7,046 + $4,554 + $0 + $51,192 = $198,665
4. Line 10 (from Schedule 1, line 26) = $168 + $0 + $2,935 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $3,261 + $1,233 + $0 + $0 + $630 = $8,227 (sum of Schedule 1 Lines 11-24)
5. Line 11 (AGI) = Line 9 - Line 10 = $198,665 - $8,227 = $190,438
For Line 12 (Standard Deduction):
- Filing status is qualifying surviving spouse
- Taxpayer is blind (1 box checked)
- Using Standard Deduction Chart: $29,200
6. Line 14 = Line 12 + Line 13 = $29,200 + $1,094 = $30,294
7. Line 15 (taxable income) = Line 11 - Line 14 = $190,438 - $30,294 = $160,144
For Line 16 (Tax):
Since taxable income is over $100,000, using Tax Computation Worksheet:
- Filing status is qualifying surviving spouse, using Tax Computation Worksheet Section B
- $160,144 falls in "At least $100,000 but not over $190,750" bracket
- Tax = ($160,144 × 0.22) - $9,385 = $25,846.68
8. Line 17 (from Schedule 2, Line 3) = $4,500 + $617 = $5,117 (sum of Schedule 2 Lines 1 and 2)
9. Line 18 = Line 16 + Line 17 = $25,846.68 + $5,117 = $30,963.68
10. Line 20 (from Schedule 3, Line 8):
- Schedule 3, Line 7 = (Schedule 3) Line 6d + Line 6i + Line 6j = $278 + $1,811 + $913 = $3,002
- Schedule 3, Line 8 = (Schedule 3) Line 1 + Line 2 + Line 3 + Line 4 + Line 5a + Line 5b + Line 7 = $672 + $1,856 + $0 + $192 + $0 + $0 + $3,002 = $5,722 (sum of Schedule 3 Lines 1-7)
11. Line 21 = Line 19 + Line 20 = $0 + $5,722 = $5,722
12. Line 22 = Line 18 - Line 21 = $30,963.68 - $5,722 = $25,241.68
13. Line 23 (from Schedule 2, Line 21) = $0 + $611 = $611 (sum of Schedule 2 Lines 4 and 17)
14. Line 24 (total tax) = Line 22 + Line 23 = $25,241.68 + $611 = $25,852.68
15. Line 32 = Line 27 + Line 28 + Line 29 + Line 31 = $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $0
16. Line 33 (total payments) = Line 25 + Line 26 + Line 32 = $18,930 + $0 + $0 = $18,930
17. Line 37 (amount owed) = Line 24 - Line 33 = $25,852.68 - $18,930 = $6,922.68
The total tax owed is $6,922.68.

Form 1040

## Income

Line 1z - Add lines 1a through 1c: $35,162 + $1,909 + $138 = $37,209

Line 9 - Add lines 1z, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7, and 8. 
First, we need to calculate Line 8 - Additional income from Schedule 1, line 10.

Schedule 1 (Form 1040)

## Part I: Additional Income

Line 10 - Combine lines 1 through 8: $1,488 + $4,549 + $0 + $46,064 + $0 + $0 + $9,157 + $888 = $62,146

Now we can calculate Line 9 of Form 1040:
$37,209 + $2,735 + $4,024 + $4 + $2,235 + $10,138 + $0 + $62,146 = $118,491

Line 10 - Adjustments to income from Schedule 1, line 26.

Schedule 1 (Form 1040)

## Part II: Adjustments to Income

Line 26 - Add lines 11 through 24: $60 + $0 + $1,229 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $843 + $591 + $0 + $0 + $167 = $2,890

Now we can calculate Line 11 of Form 1040:
$118,491 - $2,890 = $115,601

Line 12 - Standard deduction or itemized deductions (from Schedule A): 
Since the payer is married filing separately, the standard deduction is $13,850.

Line 14 - Add lines 12 and 13: $13,850 + $7,964 = $21,814

Line 15 - Subtract line 14 from line 11: $115,601 - $21,814 = $93,787

## Tax and Credits

Since the payer's taxable income is less than $100,000, we use the Tax Table to figure the tax.

2023 Tax Table

Section C—Use if your filing status is Married filing separately.

First, we divide the taxable income by 50, round it down to the nearest integer, then multiply it by 50, and finally add 25.
$93,787 / 50 = 1875.74, rounded down to 1875, then multiplied by 50 and added 25: 1875 * 50 + 25 = $93,775

| If your rounded taxable income is— | (a) Enter the amount of rounded taxable income | (b) Multiplication amount | (c) Multiply  (a) by (b) | (d) Subtraction amount | Tax. Subtract (d) from (c). Enter the result here and on the entry space on line 16. |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Over $44,725 but not over $95,375  | $93,775  | × 22% (0.22)     | $20,630.50    | $4,692.50 | $15,938.00 |

Line 16 - Tax: $15,938.00

Line 17 - Amount from Schedule 2, line 3: 

Schedule 2 (Form 1040)

## Part I: Tax

Line 3 - Add lines 1 and 2: $2,508 + $198 = $2,706

Now we can calculate Line 18 of Form 1040:
$15,938 + $2,706 = $18,644

Line 20 - Amount from Schedule 3, line 8: 

Schedule 3 (Form 1040)

## Part I: Nonrefundable Credits

Line 7 - Total other nonrefundable credits. Add lines 6d, 6i, and 6j: $419 + $2,938 + $1,891 = $5,248

Line 8 - Add lines 1 through 4, 5a, 5b, and 7: $659 + $1,113 + $0 + $900 + $0 + $0 + $5,248 = $7,920

Now we can calculate Line 21 of Form 1040:
$0 + $7,920 = $7,920

Line 22 - Subtract line 21 from line 18: $18,644 - $7,920 = $10,724

Line 23 - Other taxes, including self-employment tax, from Schedule 2, line 21: 

Schedule 2 (Form 1040)

## Part II: Other Taxes

Line 21 - Add lines 4 and 17: $0 + $67 = $67

Now we can calculate Line 24 of Form 1040:
$10,724 + $67 = $10,791

## Payments

Line 33 - Add lines 25, 26, and 32: $3,652 + $0 + $0 = $3,652

## Amount You Owe

Line 37 - Subtract line 33 from line 24: $10,791 - $3,652 = $7,139

The total tax owed is $7,139.
